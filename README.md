Recently Image recogntion has joined forces with another cutting-edge technology - augmented reality - to create an entire differnt world that provides both an entertaining and commercial value.

A lot of people have really bad memories and they just could not remember a new face. It is really awkward that when someone is waiving at you at the end of the hallway and calling your name, but you just could not remember his/her name. What if there's an App which could help you to jog your memory?
